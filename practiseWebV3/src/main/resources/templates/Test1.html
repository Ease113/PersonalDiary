	              As a UI designer, I admire the boldness of using red as the primary color in the interface of Cyberpunk
	              2077. The carefully chosen shade of soft neonish pink-red enhances most text and borders, while also
	              representing errors and danger. The skillful combination with neon cyan achieves a balanced and visually
	              harmonious result.
